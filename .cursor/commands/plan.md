# plan

Create a step-by-step implementation plan for an approved design or feature.

## Instructions

Read and follow the writing-plans skill at `.cursor/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md` exactly as presented.

The skill will guide you through:
1. Understanding the approved design or feature spec
2. Breaking work into 2-5 minute tasks
3. Specifying exact file paths, code, and verification steps
4. Ordering tasks sequentially (backend first, then frontend for full-stack)
5. Writing the plan to `docs/plans/`

## Important

- Every task must have a verification step
- Tasks should be small enough for 2-5 minutes each
- Include exact file paths and code patterns
- Reference existing project patterns
